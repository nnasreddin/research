                <p>
                    Aberrant WNT signalling pathway activation is a hallmark of colorectal cancer. The principal mechanism of aberrant WNT activation is mutation of key WNT genes, with loss-of-function mutations in <em>APC</em> and <em>RNF43</em> and gain-of-function mutations in <em>CTNNB1</em> and <em>RSPO</em> being recurrent alterations. 
                </p>   
                <p>
                    In the past decades extensive research has been undertaken to elucidate the specific contribution of these WNT genes and their associated mutations to CRC development. Cell and animal models of aberrant WNT activation have aided in unveiling that WNT hyperactivation is sufficient to trigger increased proliferation, prevent cell death and halt differentiation in mutant cells. However, with increasing recognition of the role of tissue environment on the natural selection of these mutation-driven characteristics, elucidation of the interactions between malignant cells and their neighbouring wild-type cells has become vital. 
                </p>   
                <p>
                    Recent studies have shown that <em>Apc</em> mutations in Lgr5-positive cells give rise to super-competitor cells, whereby mutant cells hold an endogenous fitness advantage provided by the intrinsic and constitutive WNT activation, coupled with suppression of neighbouring wild-type cells’ stemness and promotion of their differentiation though the secretion of the WNT negative regulator Notum. This allows <em>Apc</em>-mutant cells to “fix” and outcompete wild-type cells. However, the dynamics between <em>Rspo</em>-mutant, <em>Rnf43</em>-mutant and <em>Ctnnb1</em>-mutant cells, and their respective neighbours is yet to be described. </p>
                <p>
                    In this study, the cell dynamics between <em>Rspo3</em>-mutant cells and their neighbouring cells was investigated in human lesions and murine models of WNT disruption. First, the expression of <em>NOTUM</em> was compared between <em>APC</em>-mutant and <em>RSPO</em>-mutant human and murine lesions. Contrary to the profound <em>NOTUM</em> expression seen in <em>APC</em>-mutant lesions, no expression of <em>NOTUM</em> was found in the <em>RSPO3</em>-mutant lesions, suggesting that <em>RSPO3</em>-mutant cells might not suppress their neighbouring cells’ stemness. Furthermore, in the assessment of <em>Apc</em>-mutant (<em>Apc</em><sup>fl/fl</sup>Vil1-Cre<sup>ERT2</sup>) and Rspo3-overexpressing murine models (<em>Rspo3</em><sup>inv/+</sup>Vil1-Cre<sup>ERT2</sup>, <em>Rspo3</em><sup>inv/+</sup><em>Atoh1</em>-Cre<sup>ERT2</sup> and <em>Rspo3</em><sup>inv/+</sup>Gli1-Cre<sup>ERT2</sup>) a dramatic increase in Paneth cells in the small intestine of the <em>Rspo3</em>-mutant models was observed.  Further assessment of this in a case-control, multiple timepoint experiment in <em>Rspo3</em><sup>inv/+</sup><em>Atoh1</em><sup>-/-</sup>-Cre<sup>ERT2</sup> mice revealed that Rspo3 expression caused an expansion of Paneth cells, with overexpression of Rspo3 in Lgr5-negative cells favouring both cell endogenous and exogenous skewing of secretory cell fate towards Paneth cells. 
                </p>   
                <p>
                    Given their role as a source of WNT ligands, an increase in Paneth cells, coupled with the presence of elevated Rspo3, is believed to create a WNT-high environment that could potentially promote stemness in all (mutant and wild-type) cells within the milieu. Based on these observations a selfish versus altruistic cell dynamics model is proposed. According to this, <em>Apc</em> mutations in Lgr5-positive cells give rise to selfish super-competitors, which act by promoting their own stemness while suppressing that of their neighbouring cells. On the contrary, <em>Rspo3</em>-mutant cells’ expression of Rspo3 supports their own and their neighbouring cells’ stemness by potentiating WNT signalling, through the direct effect of secreted Rspo3 and an expansion of Paneth cells. In essence, while <em>Apc</em>-mutant cells secrete a WNT suppressor, which causes a depletion of WNT ligands for surrounding cells, <em>Rspo3</em>-mutant cells secrete a WNT potentiator, which enhances and amplifies WNT ligand availability for all cells in the milieu. Based on this work is currently undergoing to directly measure the effects on Rspo3 on stem cell fate in in vivo and in vitro models.
